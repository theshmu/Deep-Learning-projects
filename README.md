MLP-Manual-song-year-classification: Shows how to implement a deep MLP without use of packages such as pytorch.
MLP-word-prediction: Shows how to implement a deep MLP with multi-class classification using pytorch.
CNN-shoe-pair-matcher: Implementation of 2 CNNs for image classification and comaparing different data configurations.
VAE-face-generation: An example of a generational DNN implemented with a VAE with the task of generating new faces.

To be added:
MLP-CNN comparison for image classification
